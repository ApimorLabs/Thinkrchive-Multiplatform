# Project Details

Thinkrchive - Multiplatform is an Android & Desktop app that shows specifications and details of
various Lenovo Thinkpad models. This project was made to try out Jetpack Compose and Kotlin
Multiplatform so that I can see how I could adopt it to my own personal apps.

This app will also be documented heavily so that it can help anyone else in the future that is
trying to get into Kotlin Multiplatform to support Android and Desktop
via [Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-mpp/)

> This repo is a Mutliplatform version of the initial [Thinkrchive](https://github.com/racka98/ThinkRchive) which was Android only

## üßê Fun Facts

:::tip Fun little facts

- ThinkRchive originally
  used [a google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cFrYzzAP7i3bzSLKuBMykz3ZNUbf-YPTqRSEAwINy_E/edit?usp=sharing)
  as the backend via [Retrosheet](https://github.com/theapache64/retrosheet)

- ThinkRchive now
  uses [a custom Ktor powered server client](https://github.com/racka98/Thinkrchive-Server) as the
  backend. The backend is hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com)

- I mocked the designs for this app on Figma and the finished app looks better than my initial
  designs
